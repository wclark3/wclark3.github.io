My first post is a tutorial, mostly for my own reference, on how to install Octave from source on a bare-bones Linux distro. I imagine that the rest of the posts will be similar in that they will likely focus narrowly on a technical issue I'm having, so this is mostly a venue for me to jot down some thoughts that may be of interest to a very small number of other people.

On a personal note, I'm an MBA candidate at the University of Chicago. I used to work on macroeconomic research at the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve.

The layout of this blog was shamelessly stolen from Tom Preston-Werner. His blog is <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">here</a>, and the associated Github repo is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io">here</a>. His post on <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">blogging like a hacker</a> is awesome and got me started with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I've recently re-styled this using <a href="http://www.getmdl.io/" target="_blank">Material Design Lite</a> which I highly recommend as well.
